Research done while doing for notification Module
    1: I was searching for a best solution to design a notification schema in No-SQL database.
    2: I am currently using MongoDB and express.js.
    
    i) receiver{
        receiver: [{type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref:'User'}]
        note: I have keep the receiver field as an array of objects and the object is referred to user collection, 
        if needed for population. The receiver can be one person or many persons. So, the receiver field will hold the IDs of the recipients.
    }
    ii) message{
        note: Message field is used for holding the notification message details.
    }

    iii) type{
        note: type field is used for holding the types of notification to be sent.
    }

    iv) status{
        note: this is the type of field where to know the receiver has received the notification or not {either true || false}
    }

    v) created_at{
        note: this field simply holds the notification creation date and time.
    }

    vi read_by{
     read_by:[{
     readerId:{type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref:'User'},
     read_at: {type: Date, default: Date.now}

    The read_by field is an array of two object properties. this object contain readerId(user id) and read_at (the seen date-time).
    The read_by array reduced many works and has given more advanced option to work with. 
    It will be used to track each recipientâ€™s view time to track. So,
    the notification sender can track which recipient has read the message in which time.

    }
